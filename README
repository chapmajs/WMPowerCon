Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMAPM monitors the APM statistics through the APM support in
the Linux and FreeBSD Kernels.  This information, presented in
a nice visual format, can be invaluable on laptops (as I have
found in my recent/continual travels as a Field Engineer for a
small computer hardware manufacturer).

WMAPM compiles successfully on both 2.0.x and 2.1.1xx kernels
using libc5 and libc6 (glibc2), and on FreeBSD 3.x-RELEASE/
FreeBSD-3.x-STABLE.

WMAPM currently provides:

        * Status of power supply (battery or AC);
        * Percentage of battery remaining (numeric and meter);
        * Battery charging status;
	* Time left to battery depletion;
	* High/Low/Critical battery status (Red/Yellow/Green);
